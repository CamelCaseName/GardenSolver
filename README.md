 =========== GERMAN ONLY UI CURRENTLY ================

 A small project done for my own garden to optimise the placement of different plant types and kinds in different planters.

 This project allows you to:

   1. Setup your own planters with a specific size, their nutrition value and the preferred plant families (UI unfinished)
   2. Optimise the given planters by moving plant families between planters and suggesting new ones which improve overall planter quality (UI missing)
   3. Specify the exact kinds for each family and define distances, important time frames and an estimated yield (Not yet implemented)
   4. Get a detailed placement plan for each planter based on plant and personal preferences and planter history(Code WIP, UI missing)

This code is mostly done for myself, so that I can use it, if you have an improvement/suggestion, feel free to create an issue or PR.

A special thanks to @CamelCaseName for helping me start this entire project.
